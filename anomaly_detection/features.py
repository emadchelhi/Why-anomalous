def logarithm(x, t):
    """
    Compute the logarithm of the sum of x and t.

    This function calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of the quantity (x + t), 
    where x and t can be floats, lists, numpy arrays, or pandas Series. It is useful 
    for transforming data in various numerical and statistical applications.

    Args:
        x (Union[float, list, np.ndarray, pd.Series]): The first input value(s).
        t (float): The second input value to be added to x. Should be a non-negative number.

    Returns:
        Union[float, np.ndarray, pd.Series]: The natural logarithm of the sum of x and t.
